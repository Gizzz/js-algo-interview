# JS Algorithms for Coding Interview

This repo contains `JavaScript` implementations of algorithms and data structures listed in [Coding&nbsp;Interview&nbsp;University](https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university) study plan (core part, [Topics of Study](https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university#topics-of-study) section).

Contents:
- algorithms:
  - binary search
  - insertion sort
  - heapsort
  - quicksort (3-way partitioning + randomized pivot selection)
  - mergesort
  - counting sort
  - radix sort (LSD version to sort numbers)
- data-structures:
  - dynamic array (aka resizable array)
  - linked list (singly-linked, with and without tail pointer)
  - stack
  - queue
  - heap
  - priority queue
  - binary search tree
  - graph (adjacency list, adjacency matrix)
  - hashtable (open adressing)
