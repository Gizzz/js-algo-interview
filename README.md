# JS Algorithms for the Interview

Implementation of algorithms and data structures is guided by [Coding Interview University](https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university) repo.

This repository is the fork of [JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures](https://github.com/trekhleb/javascript-algorithms). Configurations (eslint, jest) are mostly the same but algorightm implementations are different. Original implementations can also be found in `src/original-src/` folder.
